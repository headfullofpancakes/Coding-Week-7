        EXAMPLE FAQ

        FAQ
            YOUR CALENDAR
                -There are a lot of things on the schedule. What events should I attend?
                    *We wanted the schedule a holistic view of the events we've planned, but please only join in for the events shown under your RSVP.

                -When should I arrive and how long should I stay?
                    *Most of the events kick off on Friday night and end on Sunday afternoon, but please enjoy the area for as long as you're able.


            YOUR SUITCASE
                -What should I wear? shoes, dress, etc.
                    *Shoes: Weather permitting, the ceremony and parts of the reception will be outdoors, so shoes that can traverse gravel 
                     and grass would make your life easier.

                    *Dress: Wear whatever makes you feel classy without sacrificing your comfort. Think ‘Cate Blanchett goes camping’.

                -Should I pack anything special?
                    *The hotel will have a pool, and if the temperature is right, the area has a lot of swimming holes you may or may not want to explore. 
                     If so, a bathing suit is a must! Hiking boots/comfortable sneakers would also ensure your ability to explore in comfort.

                -What will the weather be like in Asheville that time of year?
                    *Asheville averages a high of 77F and a low of 57F during the month of September. A light jacket and/or rain gear may be useful during your stay.


            YOUR BELLIES
                -Will you be serving alcohol at the reception?
                    *Yes, we will be serving beer and wine, along with an assortment of non-alcoholic beverages.

                -Will you be accommodating any diet restrictions?
                    *We will accommodate full vegetarian meals and have a few gluten free options. If you have any dietary concerns, please feel free to let us know 
                     so we can explore options for you!

            YOUR PHOTOS
                -Can I take pictures during the ceremony?
                    *Uh, yeah, yadoiiiii

                -What hashtag should I use for sharing photos from other times of the weekend?
